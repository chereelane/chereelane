- 👋 Hi, I’m @chereelane
- 👀 I enjoy learning new and complicated technologies ... I love a challenge 😏. Additionally, I love to get to know other fellow developers and try out new technologies.
- 🌱 My go to tech stack is as follows:
- Frontend
  - Next.js
  - React.js
- Backend
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
- CMS
  - Contentful
  - Sanity
- DB
  - Mongodb
  - Firebase

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on full stack websites that solve real world pain. An example would be my freelancer dahsboard webapp (in progress) that is displayed in my projects.
